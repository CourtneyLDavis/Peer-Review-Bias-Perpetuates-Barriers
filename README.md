## Abstract
Peer review is central to the scientific process and scientists’ career advancement, but bias at various stages of the review process disadvantages some scientists. Here we use peer review data from 312,740 biological sciences manuscripts across 31 studies to (1) examine evidence for differential peer review outcomes based on author demographics; (2) evaluate the efficacy of solutions to reduce bias; and (3) describe the current landscape of peer review policies for 541 ecology and evolution journals. We found notably worse review outcomes (e.g., lower overall acceptance rates) for authors whose institutional affiliations were in Asia, whose primary language is not English, and in countries with relatively low Human Development Indices. We found few data evaluating efficacy of interventions outside of reducing gender bias through double-blind review or diversifying reviewer/editorial boards. Despite evidence for review outcome gaps based on author demographics, few journals currently implement policies intended to mitigate bias (e.g., 15.9% of journals practiced double-blind review and 2.03% had their own reviewer guidelines on their websites that mentioned social justice issues). We advise journals to act now to collect data to evaluate the extent of and solutions to mitigate peer review bias, while moving swiftly to implement evidence-based best practices.

### Meta Analysis
This folder contains all of the data generated and analyzed as part of the meta-analysis conducted in the current study. The objectives of our meta-analysis were to:
 1. examine evidence for differential peer review outcomes in the biological sciences at multiple stages of the review process based on demographics of the first, corresponding, and last authors; and 
 2. evaluate the efficacy of proposed solutions to reduce bias, including double-blind review and editor/reviewer diversity. 
 
These analyses leverage data from 31 studies, which cumulatively examined >312,740 manuscripts submitted to >640 journals. Our dataset represents >4,513,345 author position/demographic/review stage interactions.

### Journal Policy Summaries
This folder contains all of the data generated and analyzed to describe the current landscape of journal policies in the subfields of ecology and evolution. For this, we collected peer review policy data from the websites of 541 journals, including information on each journal’s publisher, language requirements, peer review model, and reviewer guidelines, among others. To learn more about how these datasets were generated and analyzed, please see the Online Methods associated with the article.
