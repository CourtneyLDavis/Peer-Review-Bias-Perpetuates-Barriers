## Abstract
Peer review is central to the scientific process and scientists’ career advancement, but bias at various stages of the review process disadvantages some scientists1–5. Here we use peer review data from 312,740 biological sciences manuscripts across 31 studies to (1) examine evidence for differential peer review outcomes based on author demographics; (2) evaluate the efficacy of solutions to reduce bias; and (3) describe the current landscape of peer review policies for 541 ecology and evolution journals. We found notably worse review outcomes (e.g., lower overall acceptance rates) for authors whose institutional affiliations were in Asia, whose primary language is not English, and in countries with relatively low Human Development Indices. We found few data evaluating efficacy of interventions outside of reducing gender bias through double-blind review or diversifying reviewer/editorial boards. Despite evidence for review outcome gaps based on author demographics, few journals currently implement policies intended to mitigate bias (e.g., 15.9% of journals practiced double-blind review and 2.03% had their own reviewer guidelines on their websites that mentioned social justice issues). We advise journals to act now to collect data to evaluate the extent of and solutions to mitigate peer review bias, while moving swiftly to implement evidence-based best practices.
